# Unity-Extra-Scripts-C-
This is basically where I put any of the left over scripts that I think that people may need. Most aren't for a YouTube video, but if there is any of them that is for a YouTube Video, it will be at the top in a comment. If you have any ideas, Please feel free to ask, If I don't reply fast, contact me on twitter (@DILLIONonYT).

I do attempt to explain it via comments. However, if you do not understand, please contact my twitter, I do not mind explaining it to anyone, because no one is "perfect", I won't judge.

I wish you luck in your projects nontheless!
